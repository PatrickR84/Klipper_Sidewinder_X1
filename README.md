# Klipper_Sidewinder_X1
This is my current Klipper config for the Artillery Sidewinder X1 with a BL Touch.

There are some issues with Klippers PID autotune with the bed heater. The values that are currently active allow a stable temperature with little delay. The autotune values for the heater make it heat approx. 8 degrees celcius above target and fluctuate more than 3 degrees leading to Z-banding on the print.

This config has not been tuned for linear advance or input shaping.

Use at your own risk and feel free to use, modify and share.
